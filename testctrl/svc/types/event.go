// Event represents an action at a specific point in time on a subject. Likely, the subject is a
// Session or Component. Events are designed to be chained together, creating a log of all
// significant points in time.
//
// Event instances can be created through the constructor or through a literal. The constructor,
// NewEvent, provides several conveniences.  First, it sets the Time to time.Now. Second, it accepts
// a ResourceNamer for the subject. This allows events to be created using the syntactic sugar of
// subject objects themselves.
